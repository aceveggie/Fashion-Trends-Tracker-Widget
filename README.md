Fashion-Trends-Tracker-Widget
=============================

This WordPress widget displays Fashion Trends in a fashion blog in different tabs (tracked over time). It enables the fashion blogger to keep a note of fashion trends one is creating in a blog. These Fashion Trends can be further used to track happening fashion trends in a blog and extract useful statistics.

Things to do:
1) Automatically update database when uninstalled.
2) Add more options to calculate the maximum number of accordions (max 2-3).
3) Add more options to calculate the maximum of days in past to calculate the trends.
4) Add logic to calculate real trends (or change them to tags).
